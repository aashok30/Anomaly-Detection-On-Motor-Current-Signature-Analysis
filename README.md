This project is all about the Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) where you have to detect anomalies and create a machine learning model by the given data set which contains real-time current readings of a 3-phase AC motor (3.2hp) :

Roadmap To The Project
• Create a function to extract the data from a txt file and convert it into a data frame.

• Perform some EDA on the dataset to know the insight.

• Normalized the data before detecting anomalies.

• Detect anomalies with the help of the Isolation forest library (i.e, -1 denotes anomalies)

• Arrange the data in a structured way by applying K-Means algorithms.

• Balance the data to build a Machine Learning Model.

• Split, Scale and train the data for building the model.

• Compared the model base on performance metrics such as the Confusion matrix and ROC AUC curve.
